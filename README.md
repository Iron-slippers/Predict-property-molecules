# Predict-property-molecules
The main task of the hackathon was to predict the value of IC50 by the structural formula of the molecule.

A dataset of 35 thousand lines was given, in which there was the name of the compound, the value of IC50 and the structural formula.

# Manual
1) Preprocessing data.
2) There are two descriptors to choose from:
   a) transforms a molecule into an adjacency matrix;
   b) transforms a molecule into a set of meaningful features.
3) Neural network training based on Keras.
4) Presentation of the results in the form of a figure.
